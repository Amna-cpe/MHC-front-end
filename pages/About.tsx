                <p>oWhen we started Delesign, it was primarily
                    to address a number of personal issues that
                    we encountered while working in the entrepreneurial environment. We needed talented designers, but werenâ€™t yet able to afford or justify hiring a
                    full-time senior level designer, let alone one designer that was skilled in a variety of design fields.</p>
